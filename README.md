- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JessKaria, I am a junior full-stack developer, digital marketer and designer.

- I have previous experience delivering digital marketing campaigns for large enterprise clients including Microsoft, Worldpay and Accenture. My interest in coding started at my most recent role, building custom websites, workflows and marketing automations. I believe my solid foundation in marketing and SEO coupled with my passion for coding gives me a unique perspective on development. I'm now looking to join a dynamic company where I can apply my skills and continue to learn new ones.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building awesome digital experiences and telling everyone about my hot sauce company, www.baucebrothers.com

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Python, Django, Flask, MongoDB, Vanilla JS, SASS and everything inbetween.
